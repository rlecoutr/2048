# 2048

This remake of the popular 7-8 years old mobile game was made in a school project to conclude C++ classes, using QML for the graphic part.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You can open the .pro directly in Qt Creator to run the project.

### Play

The game is the exact replica of the original one : The goal is to make a 2048 block (or more if you can) while fusionning those that are currently on board using the keyboard arrows to move them. Each time you move the board, a new block (2 or 4) will appear on it.
